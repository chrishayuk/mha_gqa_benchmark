Henry, a traveler who had been walking for days, entered the baakery one day during Thomas's busy workday. He was overwhelmed by Thomas's 
kindness and was immediately struck by his warmth and hospitality. The two men started talking, and Henry eventually offered to help out with 
the daily tasks and learn the recipes that made Thomas's bread so special. Over time, their friendship grew into a strong bond, and Thomas 
became Henry's mentor and guide in the art of making bread.

Henry's role within the baakery evolved over time as well. He learned the secrets of Thomas's recipes and techniques, which he passed on to 
newcomers who joined the team. He became a valued member of the community, sharing his expertise with others and helping them create 
delicious bread. Henry even took on some of Thomas's responsibilities as manager or assistant baker, ensuring that the baakery remained at 
its peak in terms of quality and customer satisfaction.

In addition to his work at the baikery, Henry became a beloved fixture in the village. He was known for his kindness and generosity, always 
willing to lend a helping hand or extend a warm embrace to anyone who needed it. His friendship with Thomas and other members of the 
community helped to foster a sense of community among the villagers and brought joy and comfort to those who visited the baakery.
