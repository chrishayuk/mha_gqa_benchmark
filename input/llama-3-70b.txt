The traveler named Henry played a significant role in the bakery's continued success. Initially, he was a weary man who stumbled upon the 
bakery while searching for work and a place to rest. Thomas, being the kind and generous person that he was, took Henry under his wing, 
offering him a job at the bakery.

Over time, Henry became an integral part of the bakery, learning the secrets of Thomas' recipes and techniques that made the bread so 
special. He worked side by side with Thomas in the early morning hours, sharing stories and laughter as they baked. Their relationship 
evolved from one of mentor and apprentice to a strong bond of friendship.

Henry's role in the bakery's success was multifaceted:

1. **Assistance**: Henry helped Thomas with the daily tasks, alleviating some of the workload and allowing Thomas to focus on other aspects 
of the business.
2. **Knowledge transfer**: As Henry learned the secrets of Thomas' recipes and techniques, he became a skilled baker in his own right, 
ensuring that the bakery's traditions and quality would be maintained even after Thomas' eventual retirement.
3. **New perspectives**: Henry, being an outsider who had traveled extensively, brought new ideas and insights to the bakery, which helped to 
keep the business fresh and innovative.

Ultimately, Thomas entrusted the bakery to Henry, confident that his friend would continue the tradition of excellence and kindness that had 
defined it for so long. Under Henry's care, the bakery remained a beloved institution in the village, continuing to bring joy and nourishment 
to the community.
