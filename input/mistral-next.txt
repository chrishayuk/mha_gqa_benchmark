Henry initially arrived at the bakery as a weary traveler seeking work and a place to rest. Thomas, moved by his exhaustion, offered him a seat, fresh bread, and eventually a job at the bakery. Henry gratefully accepted and began helping with daily tasks while learning the art of baking from Thomas.

Over time, Henry became an essential part of the bakery, mastering Thomas's recipes and techniques. The two men developed a strong bond, working together and sharing stories during their early morning baking sessions. Their friendship and generosity contributed to the bakery's reputation and success.

When Thomas grew old, he entrusted the bakery to Henry, confident that his friend would maintain its legacy of excellence and kindness. Under Henry's care, the bakery continued to thrive as a welcoming place where everyone could enjoy delicious bread baked with love.
